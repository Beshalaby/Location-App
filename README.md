*maxmind* is an application that allows users to find and explore tourist destinations in MD District 6 and the surrounding area. Users would be able to take virtual tours of the landmarks in the area or find new locations to tour in-person.

As of September 2021, *maxmind* is still in early development.

# Inspiration

This is our Congressional App Challenge project.

Current applications like Google Maps are impractical for finding new landmarks as they include all landmarks, regardless of relevance or interest. The best alternative to *maxmind* is online articles, which are non-interactable, hard to use, and usually poorly-written. 

Only the most famous landmarks can afford to pay someone to create a virtual touring experience. Even if every landmark had their own virtual touring experience, it would be painful to find each tour on the internet. 

*maxmind* aims to eliminate these problems by creating an interactable map and compilation of landmarks and virtual tours. Additionally, *maxmind* wants to bring life back to the MD District 6 tourism industry.
