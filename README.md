*maxmind* is an application that allows users to find and explore tourist destinations in MD District 6 and the surrounding area. Users would be able to take virtual tours of the landmarks in the area or find new locations to tour in-person.

As of September 2021, *maxmind* is still in early development.

# Inspiration

This is our Congressional App Challenge project.

Current applications like Google Maps are impractical for finding new landmarks as they include all landmarks, regardless of relevance or interest. The best alternative to *maxmind* is online articles, which are non-interactable, hard to use, and usually poorly-written. For virtual tourists, their experience would be highly limited as only the most famous landmarks can afford to pay someone to create a virtual tour. Even if every landmark had their own virtual tour, it would be painful to find each one on the internet. 

*maxmind* aims to eliminate these problems by creating an interactable map and compilation of landmarks and virtual tours, bringing life back to the local tourism industry.
